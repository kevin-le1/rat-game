Project title: The Life of a Rat


  Required Questions

A. Summarize your proposed three features (your features might have
changed slightly after the proposal, so this is so your advisor knows
the current status of your plans):

Feature 1.
Our first feature registers player's choices through their mouse inputs. In doing so, each button clicked implies a different action and results
in a different game outcome.

Feature 2.
Our second feature utilizes Princeton's Standard Draw library to create the different backgrounds/settings of the game, the buttons that prompt
the players' next actions, and the corresponding text.

Feature 3.
Our third feature keeps track of the player's progress throughout the game - as the objective is to find all of the necessary ingredients to
make a cake, it will keep track of which ones have been found. The game will also keep track of the happiness and hunger levels of the rat throughout
the game to make sure if any of the elements are too low, the game will end. This will also be updated in response to the players' actions and choices
made throughout the game.

B. Summarize what you have implemented for each feature:

Feature 1.
For the first feature, we have implemented code that registers whether or not the mouse has been clicked, and corresponding actions that
should occur as a result. Upon clicking a button, the game screen will transform to the next scene (i.e. the game will start upon signing the
contract and reading the instructions).

Feature 2.
For the second feature, we have uploaded our images to the file and used the Standard Draw library to display them on the screen when the
player runs the game. This includes the starting screen, instructions, backgrounds/settings, and the mouse itself.

Feature 3.
For the third feature, we have uploaded images to visually represent the players' happiness and hunger levels.

Other Code (optional, in case you have extra code).

C. Estimate what you have left to implement for each feature:

Feature 1.
For the first feature, we still have to encode all of the different decisions available to the players and the corresponding results that
occur after choosing each option.

Feature 2.
For the second feature, we still have to finalize all of the different settings of the game and upload the images.

Feature 3.
For the third feature, we still have to create methods to keep track of the rat's happiness and hunger levels, update them corresponding to
the actions taken by the player, and keep track of the player's progress throughout the game.

Other Code (optional, in case you have extra code).
